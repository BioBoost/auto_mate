# Auto Mate for TWIN sessions

## How to get the script ?

Login using the admin account

```
cd /
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BioBoost/auto_mate/master/automate.sh
sudo chmod +x automate.sh
```

## How to execute ?

```
cd
./auto_mate.sh
```

Make sure to execute the script twice (reboot in between is needed)

Always good idea to do a git pull before executing the script
